Unsupervised Learning -- Cluster unlabeled data into groups with similar properties

## Goal of the project
The main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution's products for a mailout campaign.

### How to achieve the goal
Analyze the attributes of the existing clients and match them to the database with people in Germany.

In this project, I use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.

## Datasets
In this project we have two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company.
